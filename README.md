# VISC-C/I

A visual complexity dataset that includes both single-score data as well as two-dimensional annotations of simple and complex regions. Two datasets are included; a collection upright scenes with the aforementioned human data, and a collection of inverted scene images with corresponding complexity ratings.

# VISC-C

Upright scene images, complexity scores, and complexity maps. For visualisation purposes, complexity maps normalised by annotation count are available. For data processing purposes, the base maps should be used.

# VISC-CI

Inverted scene images, complexity scores and complexity maps for these inverted scene images.
